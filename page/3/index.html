        <h1 itemprop="headline" class="post-title"><a class="title-link" href="/blog/2016/04/deprecating-optional-get/">Deprecating Optional.get()</a></h1>

        <span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>On the OpenJDK core mailinglist (and Twitter) there is a discussion about Java’s <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html">Optional</a>.
Before diving into that discussion, lets take a look at what Optional does and how you can use it.</p>

<h2 id="checking-for-null">Checking for null</h2>

<p>What do you do when your code calls an external service or <em>god forbid</em> a microservice, and the result isn’t always available?</p>

<p>Most of the time the protocol you are using facilitates in the optional part, for example in REST you’ll get a <em>404</em> instead of JSON. Getting this <em>404</em> forces you to think about this scenario and do something when this happens.</p>

<p>But what do you do when you’re calling a framework (on the boundary of your code) and the value isn’t always known?</p>

<p>You either get the value or the result is a dreaded <strong>null</strong>. This causes a lot of null checks, or bugs where the code just crashes with a NullPointerException.</p>

<p>Example (old skool, Java 7):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="nc">Order</span> <span class="n">order</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Database</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">readOrder</span><span class="o">();</span> <span class="c1">//can be null</span>
    <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">order</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="nc">ProcessResult</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">OrderEngine</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">process</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">order</span><span class="o">);</span>
        <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="kc">null</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">result</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">succeeded</span><span class="o">())</span> <span class="o">{</span>
            <span class="nc">Database</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">storeResult</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="o">);</span>
        <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This code is not very pleasant to read. But we Java programmers didn’t have or need anything better… until we started to adopt a more functional style of programming.</p>

<h2 id="javautiloptional">java.util.Optional</h2>

<p>What happens when you are processing a <em>stream</em> and some values are <em>null</em>? You don’t want null checks inside a stream! This is where Java 8’s Optional comes in. If you’re not (yet!?) using Java 8, there are other implementations as well. For example <a href="https://github.com/google/guava">Google Guava</a> has an Optional as well.</p>

<p>Optional is a class that ‘might’ have a given value in it, or not, it is optional. So how exactly is this helpful? Instead of checking for null this wrapper class can handle some situations for you.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="nc">Optional</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Order</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">order</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Database</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">readOrder</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="nc">Optional</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">ProcessResult</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">order</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">map</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nl">OrderEngine:</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">process</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="nc">Optional</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">ProcessResult</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">filteredResult</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">result</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">filter</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nl">ProcessResult:</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">succeeded</span><span class="o">);</span>

    <span class="n">filteredResult</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">ifPresent</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nl">Database:</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">storeResult</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Or the shorter ‘fluid’ version:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="nc">Database</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">readOrder</span><span class="o">()</span>
        <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">map</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nl">OrderEngine:</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">process</span><span class="o">)</span>
        <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">filter</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nl">ProcessResult:</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">succeeded</span><span class="o">)</span>
        <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">ifPresent</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nl">Database:</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">storeResult</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Even if the <em>Optional</em> is empty in either reading the order or processing the order… nothing breaks. No NullPointerException, nothing, just no executed lambda storing the result in the end. We’ve eliminated the need for a null check.</p>

<p>As you can see Optional can really clean up your code. You don’t need to worry about null checks anymore.</p>

<p>So what is the problem with Optional.get()?</p>

<h2 id="optionalget-deprecation-discussion">Optional.get() deprecation discussion</h2>

<p>Pretty much out of the blue on the OpenJDK mailinglist <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/core-libs-dev/2016-April/040484.html">an email arrived</a> with a <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/guide/webrevHelp.html">webrev</a> (similar to a patch file) that contained the deprecation of <em>Optional.get()</em>.</p>

<p>The get() method is too easy to find, and the name isn’t quite what you’d expect, and the webrev author claims there are a lot of cases online where people made the same mistakes.</p>

<p>Many programmers, when they first encounter <em>Optional</em>, don’t know what to do. They look in their IDE and the first thing that pops up is <em>get()</em>.</p>

<p>It is just an easy method to call:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="nc">Order</span> <span class="n">order</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Database</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">readOrder</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This works fine! Until there is a situation where the value is not available to the <em>Optional</em>. In that case it will throw an NoSuchElementException. How can we solve this? Well, we could do the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="nc">Optional</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Order</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">maybeOrder</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Database</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">readOrder</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">maybeOrder</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">isPresent</span><span class="o">())</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="nc">Order</span> <span class="n">order</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">maybeOrder</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is the ‘safe’ way, but it could just as well have been a null check now. There is likely a much cleaner way to process your <em>Optional</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to do something with the result, use <em>filter</em>, <em>map</em>, <em>ifPresent</em> (and many others).</li>
  <li>If you need to return something, either return an Optional yourself, or get a default value by calling <em>orElse</em>, <em>orElseGet</em> or <em>orElseThrow</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is all you need, why have a <em>get</em>-method?</p>

<p>The proposal on the mailinglist is to deprecate the <em>get()</em> method and rename it to <em>getWhenPresent()</em>. This name change should warn people that it might not be present and they should check <em>isPresent</em> before calling <em>get()</em>.</p>

<p>Instead of embracing this change some people on the mailinglist argue against deprecation, some of their reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Renaming will break a <em>LOT</em> of code, well, not really break the code, it will cause deprecation warnings</li>
  <li><em>getWhenPresent()</em> instead of <em>get()</em> just adds noise to the code, it doesn’t solve anything</li>
  <li>People should just read the JavaDoc, it clearly states what <em>get()</em> does and throws</li>
  <li>Guava’s Optional also has the same <em>get()</em> method, they’ve never heard about the problem</li>
</ul>

<p>The most honest and one of the more powerful replies in the discussion was <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/core-libs-dev/2016-April/040531.html">from Brian Goetz</a> himself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the person who chose the original (terrible) name, let me weigh in…</p>

  <p>……</p>

  <p>I’d like to see it fixed, and the sooner the better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is clearly in favor of deprecation… what is your opinion? Let me know in the comments!</p>

        <h1 itemprop="headline" class="post-title"><a class="title-link" href="/blog/2016/04/the-collapse-of-java-ee/">The collapse of Java EE?</a></h1>

        <span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Recently there has been a lot of discussion about the state of Java EE and Oracle’s stewardship. There seems to be happening a lot. There is the fact that a lot of evangelist are leaving Oracle. There have been (Twitter) ‘fights’ between developers from Pivotal and Reza Rahman. And there are the Java EE Guardians, a group formed by Reza after he left Oracle.</p>

<p>And during the last JCP ‘<a href="https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2016-04-05/April-2016-Public-Minutes.html">Executive Committee Meeting Minutes</a>’ the London Java Community (LJC) openly expressed their worries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Martijn said that while he recognizes Oracle’s absolute right to pursue a product strategy and allocate resources in ways that meet their business interests, the LJC is concerned that the lack of progress and the absence of any explanation from Oracle is doing significant harm to the Java community and ecosystem.</p>

  <p>He explained that “splinter groups” are discussing taking over both the code work and thought leadership of Java EE, and that many companies are building proprietary frameworks such as microservices stacks, leading to even more fragmentation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are splinter groups forming, companies are building frameworks and stacks without following Java EE or contributing to future Java EE specs. People in the blogosphere/tweetosphere are complaining and worrying about it… but is it really a problem?</p>

<p>In my personal opinion: <strong>No</strong>.</p>

<p>There have always been companies experimenting, pioneering new technologies, without following Java EE specifications. This is for example how the Spring Framework got as big as it did. Remember however: Spring really shaped the future of Java EE, without it we might still be coding EntityBeans.</p>

<p>I think it might not even be a bad thing for Java EE to take a little break. There is a lot of unproven technology happening at the moment, for example there are the reactive frameworks and everything related to microservices. The landscape is changing quickly right now.</p>

<p>The worst thing that Java EE can do is to come up with their own new standards for these technologies while we, as developers, haven’t really worked out the quirks yet. Historically the best Java EE specs (IMHO) are the ones that came late to the party. But those are built on years of experimentation and crystallization. Those specs looked at everything the market had to offer, brought the relevant groups together and made it work.</p>

<h2 id="so-there-is-nothing-wrong">So there is nothing wrong?</h2>

<p>There is one big danger to Java EE right now. It is the fact people are complaining. If we don’t stop this, it might all become a selffulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p>Instead of worrying about Java EE, lets build tools and frameworks that are worth becoming an official spec. For example, look at the work <a href="http://blog.joda.org/">Stephen Colebourne</a> did with <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/">Joda Time</a>. He was fed up with the horrible <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html">java.util.Date</a> and decided to make something better. After years of programming and growing a huge fanbase it was finally turned into an excellent specification (<a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310">JSR-310</a>).</p>

<p>If you look at it, the most important thing Java EE might have done for us is bringing the relevant groups together, share ideas and distill the best practices (and writing those down as specifications). It is exactly the opposite of what is happening right now. I don’t mind splinter groups forming, if they get the right people together and work together towards forming solid specifications and implementations, why not?</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure Oracle (with Java EE) will take a look at the proposals and adopt them.</p>

<p>The most important thing is that we keep working together!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:
Some people have warned me that I’m being <em>too</em> optimistic. But time will tell, maybe Oracle will kill off Java EE, maybe they won’t. Maybe everything will take a turn for the worse, maybe it won’t.</p>

<p>For now I’ll just do what the Dalai Lama suggests: Choose to be optimistic, it feels better.</p>

        <h1 itemprop="headline" class="post-title"><a class="title-link" href="/blog/2016/03/flipping-the-diamond/">Flipping the diamond - JEP 286</a></h1>

        <span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>After my blogpost yesterday <a href="http://royvanrijn.com/blog/2016/03/adding-var-val-to-java">Pros and cons of JEP 286</a> I’ve received a lot of feedback.</p>

<p>The more I’ve been thinking about var/val it seems that my biggest mental hurdle is the Java 7 diamond operator. The diamond operator is good, it eliminates typing, and I like it… but I have the feeling it could be so much better!</p>

<p>Instead of (or in addition to) adding <em>var</em> and <em>val</em> I’d love to see a solution where we could ‘flip’ the side of the diamond operator.</p>

<p>Look at the following example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="c1">// Java 7 with diamond operator:</span>
    <span class="nc">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;();</span>

    <span class="c1">// Proposed var: (saves 3 characters)</span>
    <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;();</span>

    <span class="c1">// Flipped diamond operator: (larger, but more readable IMHO)</span>
    <span class="nc">List</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this case adding var/val doesn’t improve much, we still need to specify our generics <em>somewhere</em>, and now it has moved.</p>

<p>But look at the following example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="c1">// Java 7 with diamond operator:</span>
    <span class="nc">Map</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">someMap</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">someMethod</span><span class="o">();</span>

    <span class="c1">// Proposed var:</span>
    <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">someMap</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">someMethod</span><span class="o">();</span>

    <span class="c1">// Flipped diamond operator:</span>
    <span class="nc">Map</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">someMap</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">someMethod</span><span class="o">();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The thing is: There is much more to win on the LHS with the diamond operator than we currently have with the RHS diamond. In most cases you’re going to call code that has already defined the typing, in all those cases you can skip it LHS.</p>

<p>If it is possible to add <em>var</em> and infer everything, it should also be technically possible to have a flipped side diamond operator right? Or am I missing something?</p>

        <h1 itemprop="headline" class="post-title"><a class="title-link" href="/blog/2016/03/java-mail-message-as-download/">JavaMail API: Message in EML format</a></h1>

        <span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Our application was already using JavaMail (javax.mail.*) as a way to inform our users. But for logging purposes we wanted to store all the emails we send in our database (and make them downloadable using our GUI).</p>

<p>It turns out this is pretty easy to do!</p>

<p>Let’s start with some very basic email code we already had in place:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="c1">// Some method to construct a MimeMessage:</span>
    <span class="nc">Message</span> <span class="n">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">createMailMessage</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="o">);</span>

    <span class="nc">Transport</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">send</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>What we need to do now is to ‘render’ the entire email in a binary format, including all the possible attachements, multipart things, from and to headers etc.</p>

<p>It turns out there is a convinient method for doing just that: <em>message.writeTo(OutputStream)</em></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="nc">Message</span> <span class="n">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">createMailMessage</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="c1">// some method to construct a MimeMessage</span>

    <span class="c1">// Retrieve the entire message as byte[]:</span>
    <span class="nc">ByteArrayOutputStream</span> <span class="n">out</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ByteArrayOutputStream</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="n">message</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">writeTo</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">out</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="kt">byte</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">contents</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">toByteArray</span><span class="o">();</span>

    <span class="c1">// Next we store the byte[] in our database (JPA) entity:</span>
    <span class="nc">ArchivedMail</span> <span class="n">archivedMail</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ArchivedMail</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">sender</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">contents</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">LocalDateTime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">now</span><span class="o">());</span>
    <span class="n">mailArchive</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">store</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">archivedMail</span><span class="o">);</span>

    <span class="nc">Transport</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">send</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Our own little POJO entity (<em>ArchivedMail</em>) is stored in the database with some additional information that allows us to search the messages. The final step is to make a download link and present the email in a readable format to the users.</p>

<p>We’re using Wicket and thus the following example is Wicket code, but you could just as easily create a Servlet to return the data:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="c1">// Add the Wicket link-component to our page:</span>

    <span class="o">});</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Using JavaMail (javax.mail) it is very easy to get the ‘raw’ contents of an email when sending it.</p>

<p>This can be stored and downloaded in EML-format. It contains everything you need, mime, multipart, attachements and all the from/to headers.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

        <h1 itemprop="headline" class="post-title"><a class="title-link" href="/blog/2016/03/adding-var-val-to-java/">Pros and cons of JEP 286</a></h1>

        <span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>A couple of weeks ago a new JDK Enhancement Proposal (JEP) has been published: <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286">JEP 286</a></p>

<p>It proposes ‘<strong>var</strong>’ and possible also ‘<strong>val</strong>’ as a way to declare local variables. This means that for local variables you don’t need to specify the type of your variable when it can be safely infered.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="c1">// Before:</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">ten</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="nc">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;();</span>

    <span class="c1">// After</span>
    <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">ten</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">;</span>    <span class="c1">// infers int</span>
    <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">&gt;();</span>  <span class="c1">// infers ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Personally I’m not convinced this is a good idea for Java, but OTOH some of my colleagues and co-workers are very happy with the proposal.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some of the pros and cons of this proposal.</p>

<h2 id="pro-less-typing"><strong>Pro</strong>: Less typing!</h2>

<p>There is one obvious pro: Less typing.</p>

<p>‘var’ is just three characters, while most other local variables type names are much longer.</p>

<p>Instead of typing <strong>int</strong>, <strong>List</strong>, <strong>Person</strong> or <strong>SpringObjectFactoryManagerTemplateProxyDelagate</strong> you just have <strong>var</strong>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="c1">// Instead of:</span>
    <span class="nc">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">myList</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">someMethod</span><span class="o">();</span>

    <span class="c1">// You can now have:</span>
    <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">myList</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">someMethod</span><span class="o">();</span>

    <span class="c1">// We saved 10 keystrokes! (&lt;- probably less if you know shortcuts in your IDE)</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="con-readability"><strong>Con</strong>: Readability</h2>

<p>The biggest advantage of Java over other languages is the readability. The language Java is a bit verbose, but this is actually a good thing when it comes to reading the code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code is read more than it is written</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">myVariable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">dependency</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">calculateSomething</span><span class="o">();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>What is the type of <em>myVariable</em>? When you are writing the code, you probably have a good idea why you called <em>dependency</em> and what you receive as return value.</p>

<p>But when you are reading the code, there is no way of knowing what <em>myVariable</em> is… you probably need your IDE to tell you, or look at the code of the dependency.</p>

<p>I personally think this is a con regarding the JEP. I’d rather have a verbose language where the IDE helps me with autocomplete and hide things… than having a language that <em>needs</em> an IDE to help me makes sense of the code.</p>

<h2 id="pro-adding-var-doesnt-break-anything"><strong>Pro</strong>: Adding <strong>var</strong> doesn’t break anything</h2>

<p>Some peope think (and argue) that adding this feature breaks backwards compatibility (because of the new keyword).</p>

<p>But this is <strong>not</strong> true!</p>

<p>When ‘var’ gets added it won’t be a keyword, it’ll be a ‘reserved type name’. This means that the following code for example would be working just fine:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="c1">// this compiles just fine:</span>
    <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"var"</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="con-rhs-versus-lhs"><strong>Con</strong>: RHS versus LHS</h2>

<p>This JEP focusses on the LHS (left-hand side) declaration by removing the need to specify a type. But recently, in Java 7, Java has introduced the diamond operator to eliminate verbosity in the RHS (right-hand side) declaration. With JEP 286, these two collide:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="c1">// Before Java 7 'diamond operator':</span>
    <span class="nc">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;();</span>

    <span class="c1">// With Java 7 'diamond operator', removing generic type on RHS:</span>
    <span class="nc">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;();</span>

    <span class="c1">// With JEP 286, we need to add the generic type again at the RHS...</span>
    <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;();</span>

    <span class="c1">// Java, make up your mind!</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="pro-and-con-refactoring"><strong>Pro</strong> and <strong>con</strong>: Refactoring</h2>

<p>Some people have argued that, after JEP 286, refactoring can become easier.
Look at the following, silly, example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="nf">hasClosed</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">getSomeList</span><span class="o">();</span>
        <span class="k">for</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">list</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        	<span class="k">if</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">isClosed</span><span class="o">())</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        		<span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">;</span>
        	<span class="o">}</span>
        <span class="o">}</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>No matter what <em>getSomeList()</em> returns, it should work as long as it has the method <em>isClosed</em>. I think this is a weird example, because normally you would define an <strong>interface</strong> with <em>isClosed</em> and every class that implements this interface can be replaced/refactored as well.</p>

<p>There is a counter argument that can be made, refactoring can also be <em>dangerous</em> with JEP 286, look at this (crafted) example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">answer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">SomeCode</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">generate</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="nc">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">answer</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As long as the method <em>generate</em> returns a number the code works fine. But when someone changes the method to return an object or a String, it stops working without failing compilation. This argument however seems valid, but it would also break it you would have inlined the call to ‘<em>System.out.println(SomeCode.generate() + 2);</em>’.</p>

<p>This might make the problem a bit harder and more widespread. I believe there are more cases this can go wrong.</p>

<h2 id="try-it-out-for-yourself">Try it out for yourself</h2>

<p>The best way to get a feel for JEP 286 is just to try it out yourself!</p>

<p>There is a pre-compiled version of JDK-9 with JEP availabe for download at the website: <a href="http://iteratrlearning.com/jep286.html">iteratrlearning</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

<p>After looking at a lot of examples I’m still not convinced that JEP 286 is good nor bad. It can go either way.
There are some good <strong>pros</strong> but also quite a lot of <strong>cons</strong>.</p>

<p>When discussing this JEP with co-workers and colleagues I often get the following reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The arguments you’re using have been used when C# adopted var/val, stop complaining, they did it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But did you know most coding guidelines for C# warn you for using ‘var’?</p>

<p>Just read these <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff926074.aspx">guidelines from Microsoft</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use var when the type is not apparent from the right side of the assignment.</li>
    <li>Do not rely on the variable name to specify the type of the variable. It might not be correct.</li>
    <li>Avoid the use of var in place of dynamic.</li>
    <li>Use implicit typing to determine the type of the loop variable in for and foreach loops.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This, combined with readability, makes me lean towards a <em>no</em> for JEP 286 right now.</p>

        <h1 itemprop="headline" class="post-title"><a class="title-link" href="/blog/2016/01/jshell-api-design-problems/">JShell API, design problems?</a></h1>

        <span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>This weekend I continued working my project making a Java REPL adventure game that teaches the basics of programming (in Java). One main goal of starting this project was to get a better understanding of the JShell API, not just the tool. I’ve used the JDK 9 JShell command line tool before, and it worked great. But there is also a big API behind it you can programatically use.</p>

<p>Let me show you how this works:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">        <span class="nc">JShell</span> <span class="n">shell</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">JShell</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">create</span><span class="o">();</span>
        <span class="nc">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">SnippetEvent</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">events</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">shell</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">eval</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"int i = 10;"</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>What have we done here? Well first we’ve created an instance of the JShell. This is just like starting the command line tool. Now we can call the <em>eval()</em> function to evaluate Java code. As a result you receive so called <em>SnippetEvent</em>s, these are classes containing the information about what happened. Let’s see what the code above returns:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">        <span class="k">for</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">SnippetEvent</span> <span class="n">event</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">events</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
            <span class="nc">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">event</span><span class="o">);</span>
        <span class="o">}</span>

        <span class="c1">//Output: SnippetEvent(snippet=Snippet:VariableKey(i)#1-int i = 10;,previousStatus=NONEXISTENT,status=VALID,isSignatureChange=true,causeSnippetnullvalue=10)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>There is quite some information in there, the event contains the actual ‘snippet’, the piece of code that was executed. Also there is a previous state, status and some other information. This is where the JShell API starts to feel weird to me. To get the <em>Snippet</em> from the <em>SnippetEvent</em> we can call the following method:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">        <span class="nc">SnippetEvent</span> <span class="n">event</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">events</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">);</span>

        <span class="c1">// To get the information, we call snippet (not getSnippet()):</span>
        <span class="nc">Snippet</span> <span class="n">snippet</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">snippet</span><span class="o">();</span>

        <span class="c1">// Next we cast our snippet to the correct subclass:</span>
        <span class="nc">VarSnippet</span> <span class="n">vSnippet</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">VarSnippet</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">snippet</span><span class="o">;</span>

        <span class="c1">// Now we can retrieve information, for example the type we've created:</span>
        <span class="nc">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">vSnippet</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">typeName</span><span class="o">());</span>

        <span class="c1">//Output: int</span>

        <span class="c1">// We can also get the 'value' of the SnippetEvent:</span>
        <span class="nc">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">event</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">value</span><span class="o">());</span>

        <span class="c1">//Output: 10</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>There are a couple of points I don’t like about the current JShell API design here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why are the methods to <strong>get</strong> information called .snippet() and .typeName(), why not getSnippet() and getTypeName()?</li>
  <li>Why is the result of vSnippet.typeName() a <strong>String</strong>?</li>
  <li>Why is the result of event.value() a <strong>String</strong>? Didn’t we have an ‘int’?</li>
</ul>

<p>First the question about the method names. In all of the JDK code they seem to be using the bean-specification, where you have getMethods() for getting and setMethod(…) for setting. I’m not sure why this isn’t the case for the JShell API? Is this a new way Oracle is designing their API’s? Do other new JDK API’s have the same syntax?</p>

<p>Next is the question regarding the usage of Strings. Why is the value() a String when we’ve clearly made something an int? Even worse, let’s create something that is not a primitive:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">        <span class="nc">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">SnippetEvent</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">events</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">shell</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">eval</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"jdk.jshell.JShell.create();"</span><span class="o">);</span>
        <span class="nc">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">events</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">value</span><span class="o">());</span>

        <span class="c1">//Output: jdk.jshell.JShell@4cc0edeb</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It is even <em>worse</em>, the only result we get from event.value() is a String and it is clearly just the <strong>.toString()</strong> of the actual backing object. For this API I would <em>love</em> to see it returning the actual object instead. I understand the JShell tool uses String’s and communicates the toString(), but shouldn’t the API be more general? Or am I missing something here?</p>

<p>Anyway, this is exactly why <em>more</em> people should <strong>try these API</strong>’s and share the feedback! Mail your feedback and suggestions to the mailing list.</p>

<p>What do you think? Please leave a comment below, or… even better, share your thoughts on the <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/kulla-dev">mailing list</a></p>

        <span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I’ve been a big fan of the Java JShell from the early beginning. I was even the first one on the mailing list besides the people from Oracle. I’m working on a weekend/side project involving JavaFX and JShell API now for a couple of days and something was bothering me.</p>

<p>The project I’m working on is targetted at teaching kids to learn Java Programming in a fun way. But automaticly generated variable names called <em>$1</em>, <em>$2</em>, <em>$3</em> etc are not ‘fun’ enough! Luckily I found the following method in the API:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="nc">JShell</span> <span class="n">shell</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">JShell</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">builder</span><span class="o">()</span>
                <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">tempVariableNameGenerator</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">CustomNameGenerator</span><span class="o">())</span>
                <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">build</span><span class="o">();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The name generator has to implement <em>Supplier&lt;String&gt;</em>, with a single method <em>get()</em>, very easy! The generator I’ve made generates semi-random fantasy character names. This is what I’ve ended up with:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">10</span>
<span class="o">|</span>  <span class="nc">Expression</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="nl">is:</span> <span class="mi">20</span>
<span class="o">|</span>    <span class="n">assigned</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">temporary</span> <span class="n">variable</span> <span class="n">baiduth</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">type</span> <span class="kt">int</span>

<span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">baiduth</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="o">|</span>  <span class="nc">Expression</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="nl">is:</span> <span class="mi">40</span>
<span class="o">|</span>    <span class="n">assigned</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">temporary</span> <span class="n">variable</span> <span class="n">bleibriss</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">type</span> <span class="kt">int</span>

<span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">bleibriss</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">baiduth</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="mi">60</span>

<span class="o">-&gt;</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>Much better! If you’re interested in the project I’m working on, teaching kids Java with the JShell API and JavaFX, keep an eye out. When I have something worth showing I’ll push it to GitHub so everyone can enjoy it!</p>

        <span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>About a year ago someone on my current project did an initial setup of <a href="http://gatling.io/">Gatling</a>. This is a performance/stress test tool written in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, it is easy to use but very powerful. The basic idea is that you write the test scenario’s in code, the same way as you would create integration/unit tests. The advantage is that the resulting tests are easy to expand, maintain and you’ve got everything under version control.</p>

<p>One very powerful feature Gatling has is the <em>Recorder</em>. It is an application you can launch and it acts like a proxy server. Being a proxy server it can record and log all the calls you do to an application. Without writing any code it can <em>automatically</em> create a stress test!</p>

<p>But in my case someone has already created a scenario for me.</p>

<h2 id="basic-example">Basic Example</h2>

<p>As a programmer it can be a bit daunting when you encounter a ‘foreign language’, in this case Scala. Fear not though, it is very easy to read, extend and write Gatling tests. This is the scenario I started with today:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">OurSimulation</span> <span class="k">extends</span> <span class="nc">Simulation</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<p>The <em>SoapMessageTemplate.txt</em> is just a plain text file containing one SOAP call, instead of data it contains tags like: ${field1}. There is also <em>data.csv</em> which is a CSV file with the field names in the first row, comma separated values in the following rows. The tags in the SOAP call get replaced by the values from the selected CSV row.</p>

<p>There is probably nothing more I need to explain, the code reads like it should. The main startingpoint is <em>OurSimulationLocal</em>, this class sets up the <em>Simulation</em> (using <em>setUp()</em>). The <em>Simulation</em> is contructed in the <em>OurSimulation</em> class, for each call it takes the ‘next’ value from the CSV, adds one additional field and posts the message to <em>OurEndpoint</em>, finally it checks for a 200 reply.</p>

<h2 id="custom-feeder">Custom Feeder</h2>

<p>Instead of having a big list of different options in a CSV file, my task for today was to make a custom <em>Feeder</em>. It is the class that provides data as input for the SOAP messages. We want to have some random data that still makes sense to the application, based on some averages.</p>

<p>It looked pretty hard to do, not having programmed a lot of Scala. In the end it was a breeze! The only thing that bugs me is that there are so many different ways to write your code in Scala. I’m not experienced enough yet to know if it ‘reads’ like proper Scala code, I don’t yet know what ‘good’ and ‘bad’ code looks like.</p>

<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Writing a custom feeder is pretty easy to do. The apply() function creates an instance of a Feeder[String] which in turn returns a Map containing [String, String] key value pairs. These are then used to fill the SOAP template!</p>

<p>Of course the real thing I build today is a bit larger and more complex, but the code is basically the same!</p>

          <p>At the moment it is very hard for an online nerd on Twitter. Star Wars ep 7: The Force Awakens has been released into the wild and most of us haven’t seen it yet. But luckely there is a solution, I’ve created a handy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a>.</p>

<p>A bookmarklet is a piece of Javascript code that you can add as a bookmark. When you are on a certain website (like Twitter) you can press the bookmarklet and the Javascript is executed. The bookmarklet code I’m using has been created using this great website: <a href="http://www.conroyp.com/2010/03/11/declutter/">DeClutter Twitter</a> and it removes most Star Wars related tweets from your timeline!</p>

<h2 id="forcefilter">ForceFilter</h2>

<p>Just drag this bookmarklet <a href="javascript:%24(%27body%27).bind(%27ajaxSuccess%27,declutter)%3Bvoid(declutter())%3Bfunction declutter()%7Bvar rk%3D%5B%27star wars%27, %27the empire%27, %27the rebellion%27, %27han solo%27, %27theforceawakens%27, %27jar jar%27, %27kylo ren%27, %27rey%27, %27finn%27, %27poe dameron%27, %27xwing%27, %27deathstar%27, %27c-3po%27, %27r2d2%27, %27darth%27, %27jedi%27, %27sith%27, %27leia%27%5D%3B%24.each(%24(%27li.stream-item%27), function()%7Bvar c %3D %24(this).html()%3B var p %3D %24(this)%3B %24.each(rk, function(i, v)%7B if(c.toLowerCase().indexOf(v) &gt; 0)%7Bp.remove()%3B%7D%7D)%3B%7D)%3B%7D">ForceFilter</a> to the bookmark section of your browser.

        <h1 itemprop="headline" class="post-title"><a class="title-link" href="/blog/2015/12/google-guava-range-with-localdate/">Google Guava: Range with LocalDate</a></h1>

        <span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>This afternoon I was working on implementing a user story with (<a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/">JodaTime</a>) <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/LocalDate.html">LocalDate</a> ranges. The problem? I needed to represent a lot of periods, in days. The thing I needed to check: Is a certain <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/LocalDate.html">LocalDate</a> contained in this period.</p>

<p>First I started looking at JodaTime itself, it has support for Interval(s). But there is a ‘problem’, Interval is based around <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/ReadableInstant.html">ReadableInstant</a>s, and <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/LocalDate.html">LocalDate</a> is a <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/ReadablePartial.html">ReadablePartial</a>, not a <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/ReadableInstant.html">ReadableInstant</a>! So to make my code work I had to do the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="c1">// Use two LocalDate instances to create an Interval (the JodaTime way)</span>
    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="nc">Interval</span> <span class="nf">createInterval</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">LocalDate</span> <span class="n">fromDate</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">LocalDate</span> <span class="n">toDate</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="nc">DateTime</span> <span class="n">fromDateTime</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fromDate</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">toDateTimeAtStartOfDay</span><span class="o">();</span>
        <span class="nc">DateTime</span> <span class="n">toDateTime</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">toDate</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">toDateTimeAtStartOfDay</span><span class="o">();</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Interval</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">fromDateTime</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">toDateTime</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>

    <span class="c1">// Now to check an interval I needed to call:</span>
    <span class="n">createdInterval</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">contains</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">inputDate</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">toDateTimeAtStartOfDay</span><span class="o">());</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It works, sure, but the conversion to <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/ReadableInstant.html">ReadableInstant</a> with toDateTimeAtStartOfDay kind of bugged me. But luckely <a href="https://github.com/google/guava">Google Guava</a> has something to make the code much cleaner: <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/RangesExplained">Ranges</a></p>

<p>Using Range made the code much smaller and easier to read:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="c1">// Use two LocalDate instances to create an Range (the Google Guava way)</span>
    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="nc">Range</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">LocalDate</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">createRange</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">LocalDate</span> <span class="n">fromDate</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">LocalDate</span> <span class="n">toDate</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nc">Range</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">closedOpen</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">fromDate</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">toDate</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>

    <span class="c1">// To check:</span>
    <span class="n">createRange</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">contains</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">inputDate</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I really love using Google Guava, it provides solutions for a lot of common programming challenges. Not only that, their API is very <em>very</em> clean and skillfully designed. The use of open/closed in <em>Range.java</em> is very handy and makes it easy to think about corner cases.</p>

        <h1 itemprop="headline" class="post-title"><a class="title-link" href="/blog/2015/12/makeblock-robots-for-kids-an-adults/">Makeblock, robots for kids (and adults)</a></h1>

        <span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>When I left the Port of Rotterdam (over a year ago) as consultant/software developer I got a lot of cool gifts. Amongst the gifts was a small blue box from <a href="http://www.makeblock.cc/">Makeblock</a>, called the ‘robot starter kit’. It was put away on my desk and sadly I’d forgotten about it. But recently a colleague of mine showed us the robot his daughter made. She got a similar robot from Makeblock for her birthday and it ‘became her new best friend’. He asked her if he could borrow the robot for one day and show it to us at work, she reluctantly said yes.</p>

<p>When I got home I suddenly remembered the blue box I had laying around in the corner of my desk. I decided to show it to my 3 year old daughter. She loved the idea of having her own little robot in her room. Searching online I couldn’t find a suggested appropriate age for these robots so I figured: if she wants to try, just go for it!</p>

<p><img src="/images/makeblock-start.jpg" alt="Starting the assembly of the robot (bananas not included)" class="aligncenter" /></p>

<p>She immediately jumped in and started handling the screwdriver like a pro. I was amazed to see the dedication, concentration and dexterity, when I was younger I had none of the three. In about half an hour we had the base constructed and she lost interest for a little while. I decided to continue alone for 10 minutes and the only thing left to do was assembling the tank tracks. So I called her over and we decided to hold a little race, 20 rubber pieces for me, 20 for her. It was a pain to assemble, but by introducing a small competition I only had one track to assemble, she did the other one all by herself.</p>

<p>The cool thing about these robots is their simplicity: The frame goes together quickly with a couple of screws and removable rivets. All the electronics are connected by RJ25 (telephone) jacks. The kit I got had an IR-receiver (+ remote) and ultrasonic sensor. The remote is great because she is too young for programming. The moment you put it together and place the batteries you can start driving the robot around. She loved it, look at her proud smug face:</p>

<p><img src="/images/makeblock-finish.jpg" alt="I've build a robot, now what?" class="aligncenter" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Next thing I’ll do it to teach it how to dance! Then I’ll teach it how to clean my room.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That evening, when she was vast asleep, I started working on the programming. The main board in this robot is compatible with an Arduino. To program the robot you connect it to your laptop using USB and fire up the Arduino IDE with the Makeblock library. Commands are very simple to use, for example reading the distance sensor is: ‘ultraSensor.distanceCm()’. That night, when my daughter was sleeping, I added an automatic drive-mode so the robot would drive around randomly avoiding all obstacles with help of the ultrasonic sensor. When she woke up I told her ‘go ahead and hit the 0 on the remote!’. She was blown away, her little robot had grown a mind of its own!</p>

<p>When she is a bit older we’re going to try out the <a href="http://www.mblock.cc/">mBlock</a>/<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> plugin. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> (for those unfamiliar) is an environment where you can visually program with graphical blocks. It is a drag and drop environment and works very well as a first programming tool for kids. It is also something we regularly use at <a href="http://www.devoxx4kids.org/">Devoxx4Kids</a></p>

<p>Things I like about the Makeblock robot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to assemble (even for a 3yo)</li>
  <li>Instructions had a lot of images</li>
  <li>Fun to program</li>
</ul>

<p>And of course, it isn’t perfect, things I didn’t like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Should come with a CR2025 coin cell battery for the remote (I had to race to the store to get one)</li>
  <li>Instructions only had images, nothing else (bit too brief)</li>
</ul>

<p>Nontheless: <strong>Every parent should buy one!</strong></p>

Every couple of weeks we organize a hack-day at work. Being a (Java) software consulting company we usually work on exploring new Java frameworks or we contribute to open source projects. But more and more we step out of just software and bring Raspberry Pi’s and other hardware. Another example where we hacked on hardware is playing with Software Defined Radio (SDR), my colleague Bert Jan did a talk about this at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOlz0OcZPjc">Devoxx 2015</a>.</p>

<h1 id="broken-roomba">Broken Roomba</h1>

<p>A couple of days before our last hack-day my wife was carrying our old ‘broken’ Roomba vacuuming robot. Most vacuuming parts were worn down and the front wheel keeps dropping out of its socket. She was going to throw a robot out! I can’t let this happen, I have to save the poor bastard.</p>

<p>So I started to do a little research. I’d heard about the <a href="http://www.irobot.com/About-iRobot/STEM/Create-2.aspx">Roomba Create</a> before. It is a STEM-version of their vacuuming robot, for hacking purposes. It doesn’t have the cleaning parts, instead of has more connectors, made especially to be hacked/improved, it is the perfect base for your own little robot! I was very pleased to find that even my 500-series Roomba has a hidden mini-DIN connector that allows serial communication. iRobot provides a <a href="http://irobot.lv/uploaded_files/File/iRobot_Roomba_500_Open_Interface_Spec.pdf">full listing</a> of all the possible commands and outputs, which is a great thing!</p>

<h1 id="connecting-a-raspberry-pi">Connecting a Raspberry Pi</h1>

<p>Here is what my idea was: Take a mini-DIN cable, connect it to a Raspberry Pi and drive the Roomba myself! But I quickly run into two problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do I connect the Raspberry Pi to a DIN cable?</li>
  <li>How do I power the Raspberry Pi?</li>
</ul>

<p>After some research I was able to solve both of the problems.</p>

<h2 id="mini-din-to-raspberry-pi">Mini-DIN to Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p>After some research I found out some good and some bad news. First the good news, the Raspberry Pi has an UART TX and RX pin. These can be used to communicate with the Roomba without any effort.</p>

<p>The bad news? The Roomba has logic pins that have 0-5v and the Raspberry Pi has 0-3.3v. You can’t directly combine the two together or you’ll risk blowing a fuse on the Raspberry Pi. There is however a pretty simple solution, that is to use a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009">Logic Level Converter</a>. This is a small board that you give 3.3v + GND on one end, 5v + GND on the other end. Now it has four logic pins left that can be used to connect 3.3v logic to 5v logic bi-directionally.</p>

<p>So with a bit of creative freeform-soldering I ended up with the following extension to my Raspberry Pi:</p>

<p><img src="/images/freeform-soldering.jpg" alt="freeform-soldering" class="aligncenter" /></p>

<p>The only thing left to do next is to connect the right DIN-wires to the Raspberry Pi. But luckely the <a href="http://www.irobot.com/filelibrary/pdfs/hrd/create/Create%20Open%20Interface_v2.pdf">documentation</a> provided by iRobot had very clear images showing all the mini-DIN pins and what they do.</p>

<h2 id="powering-the-raspberry-pi">Powering the Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p>The next challenge was actually power the Raspberry Pi. The Roomba has a battery pack, 16-17v, so that would be perfect. This seemed to be an easy challenge initially because the DIN-cable also provides access to the battery pack. But just before I hooked the Raspberry Pi to the (unregulated) battery wires of the DIN cable I found that there are actually some fuses between the DIN connector and the battery pack. The Raspberry Pi would draw too much current for these fuses!</p>

<p>Next I opened up the Roomba completely. Just below the ‘Dock’ button are two big pads directly connected to the battery pack. I soldered two wires to these pads. This gave me 16v (without the fuses) to power the Raspberry Pi. But how do I step this down to the 5v needed by the Raspberry Pi? I connected the wires to a UBEC and soldered a mini-USB cable to the output. Connected to the Raspberry Pi and… it worked like a charm!</p>

<h1 id="programming-the-roomba">Programming the Roomba</h1>

<p>When we connect the Raspberry Pi to the Roomba using the DIN cable, it starts to play weird error-beeps. This is because by default the Raspberry Pi writes all console output to the serial connections (!). Please read this link to <a href="http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/raspberry-pi-serial-port">disable</a> it.</p>

<p>Like I said, the serial commands needed to drive the Roomba are perfectly documented. Using the GNU RXTX library (RXTXcomm.jar) we can write the following Java code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="c1">// On the Raspberry Pi the Serial communication pins are connected to /dev/ttyAMA0</span>

        <span class="o">}</span>

<p>Now we can send commands to the OutputStream, like documented. Using this I was able to drive the Roomba through SSH to the Raspberry Pi from my laptop!</p>

<p>For example, we can do the following:</p>

<p>If you remove the DIN cable, it’ll still function perfectly as cleaning robot. So now I have a Star Wars bot to program during the day, and a cleaning robot at night.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

        <span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Yesterday I heard a great quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea. <strong>-Antoine de Saint-Exupery</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="to-the-moon">To the moon</h1>

<p>The modern version of this quote might be: Think about the people who helped build the Saturn rockets that took us to the moon with the Apollo missions. They didn’t work on those projects because it was their job and people payed them to do it. They didn’t just follow tasks. They worked on the project because they loved to be part of this amazing voyage. Every single NASA employee is <strong>in love with space</strong> and space exploration and they do their absolute best to be part of it.</p>

<h1 id="software-development">Software development</h1>

<p>This should be the same for (Agile) software development:<br />
Don’t hire programmers and give them tasks, tell them about what you want to achieve! Enthusiasm is contagious, it is the perfect catalyst to boost productivity. When people are hired to do tasks, they do the tasks, nothing more, nothing less. When people are hired to reach for a certain goal they’ll express creativity and ingenuity. They will suggest improvements and you’ll end up with a much (MUCH) better product.</p>

        <h1 itemprop="headline" class="post-title"><a class="title-link" href="/blog/2015/11/the-most-discriminating-jug-in-the-world/">The most discriminating JUG in the world</a></h1>

        <span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>About a week ago I was talking to a colleague about the lack of female Java programmers, especially here in Western Europe. We came to this topic after hearing that at <a href="http://devoxx.ma/en/">Devoxx Morocco</a> almost <strong>a third</strong> of the attendees was female, great news! The conclusion? Some of my friends are running the most discriminating JUG in the world.</p>

<p>Here, in the Netherlands, we have just two big JUG’s (Java User Groups). There is the <a href="http://www.nljug.org/">NLJUG</a>, which covers the entire country and organises the J-Fall conference amongst other things, almost all Java coders in the Netherlands are a member. There is also <a href="http://jduchess.org/">JDuchess</a>, the female JUG. They organise meetings with fellow female coders and help them to connect with other (female) coders around the globe, they also hold regular meetups, also internationally at conferences and they are doing an awesome job hosting several Devoxx4Kids events per year. The JDuchess have been awarded (rightly so) multiple times for their effort in bringing more gender equality in the Java world.</p>

<h1 id="but">But….</h1>

<p>When you think about that… surprisingly, JDuchess is <strong>the most discriminating</strong> JUG in the world! Of all the JUGs I know, it is the only one I’ll never be allowed to join (unless I undergo a sex-change perhaps). It is the only JUG in the world that is filtering members based on gender. And in my opinion, that is a problem.</p>

<p>So, why is this a problem? It is just a group of female coders that want to hang out and help each other! Well, first of all, don’t get me wrong. Again, I love what the JDuchess are doing for the Java community, I know some of them pretty well personally and they are all very nice and have the best intention!</p>

<p>But… if you feel like you are not welcome in your local JUG as female coder and you want to do something about this. Please don’t start a ‘female only’-JUG, start a JUG where <strong>everyone</strong> is welcome and like-minded! If you want to have more equality and integration you shouldn’t be organising your own discriminating group. We need to have male and female coders to work together to solve the gender equality problems!</p>

<p>Also, I must mention: JDuchess was never about equality or discrimination. It wasn’t born out of frustration as mentioned above. It was just a way for female coders (who often felt lonely during conferences) to connect and have more ‘female-oriented’ conversations with each other.</p>

<h1 id="jduke-the-jug-of-testosterone">JDuke, the JUG of testosterone</h1>

<p>Imagine this, someone starts JDuke: the male only JUG! We do cool meetings, share experiences with other men! On conferences we proudly wear our male-only badge, because we are MEN! Next to attending sessions and giving talks at conferences we also have our own meetups, just for men of course, and we all go out for dinner, together. Everybody is welcome at our JUG, as long as you have a … are a dude.</p>

<p>The world would probably explode, how dare we do something so discriminating? But remember, this is exactly what the JDuchess have been doing all the time. Except, what they do isn’t questioned, it is applauded instead. Probably because they are (still) a minority?</p>

<h1 id="so-you-are-jealous">So… you are jealous?</h1>

<p>Yes! I want to join <a href="http://jduchess.org/">JDuchess</a> too! If I was a female I would totally love being part of their JUG.</p>

<p>But, as a male, I too want to share experiences with everyone, I too want to discuss the topic of equality. There should be no need in the world for a female JUG (which apparently there still is)! All the JUGs should be as open and inviting as the JDuchess, I’ve never seen a JUG so active and welcoming as them. They are an example for other JUGs… except their discriminating admission policy of course. Gender should not matter, it is all about having mutually shared interest.</p>

        <h1 itemprop="headline" class="post-title"><a class="title-link" href="/blog/2015/11/javaone-2015-and-devoxx-2015/">JavaOne 2015 and Devoxx 2015</a></h1>

        <span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>The last couple of weeks have been really busy for me. I’ve been to San Francisco for JavaOne 2015 (the official Java conference). After that I had just a week to recover and travelled to Antwerp in Belgium for Devoxx 2015 (the largest community driven conference).</p>

<h1 id="talking">Talking</h1>

<p>At both conferences I had the pleasure to talk about different subjects. From fun/informal Ignite sessions about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_%28Terminator%29">Skynet</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joggling">Joggling</a> to hosting a Java Pub Quiz and a live-coding introduction to JShell the new REPL (read-eval-print loop) that will be available in Java 9.</p>

<p>Here is a video of the live-coding session:</p>

<iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="390" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CN3tGi4eZZ4"></iframe>

<h1 id="youtube">YouTube</h1>

<p>One major announcement at Devoxx 2015 is that Stephan Janssen (Devoxx organizer/godfather) will stop with Parleys. Instead all the talks will be freely available on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCBVCTuk6uJrN3iFV_3vurg">Devoxx 2015 YouTube channel</a>. This brings all the excellent content from the conference to the entire community, for free!</p>

<p>If you are curious on how this video is recorded and what Devoxx looks like behind the scenes, check out the Devoxx Live video I made with Stephan Janssen:</p>

<iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="390" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SWnYWqXpNl4"></iframe>

<p>Devoxx Live is a new concept, instead of just providing all the talks we want to show you the other side of Devoxx: the hallway. This is where you meet people, talk to the sponsors, experience things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI0v4AMdrPo">drone racing</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCyAXxhAiCI">hoverboard/monowheeling</a>.</p>

<p>JavaOne has also posted a lot of sessions to YouTube, but instead of cutting everything into nice little videos they’ve decided to upload just the raw streams of the entire day. Luckely there is always ‘the community’, in this case, the people over at reddit created a nice list with video-deeplinks to the appropriate talks: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/3requx/javaone_2015_sessions/">JavaOne 2015 talks on reddit</a></p>

<h1 id="keynotes">Keynotes</h1>

<p>The first keynote at JavaOne wasn’t very interesting, most conferences just want to sell it to sponsors and don’t have any good content. The second keynote at JavaOne was the ‘community keynote’. During a theatrical play Stephen Chin took us back in time (and into the future) to keep Duke from destroying San Francisco. It was entertaining, but could really use a better screenwriter (that ending, *sigh*), but it did have a powerfull message: teaching and children are the future. This was also pretty visible at JavaOne4Kids (where I did a session with my colleagues), during this event hundreds of kids got introduced to programming and robotics.</p>

<p>The keynotes at Devoxx were (IMHO) much better, during the first keynote we heard Mark Reinhold talk about project Jigsaw and after that one of my heroes took the stage: professor Lawrance Krauss. Instead of focussing on the last 20 years of Java (which all conferences do) we took a step back and looked at the origins of our universe and life. He talked about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider">Large Hadron Collider (LHC)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational-wave_observatory">gravitational wave observatories</a>. The closing keynote at Devoxx was done by Stephen Chin and included a lot of video footage from an interview he’s done with James Gosling (the father of Java), this was fun too!</p>

<h1 id="best-sessions">Best sessions</h1>

<p>If you’ve seen the top 10-list of highest votes at Devoxx 2015 there is one name you can’t mention: Venkat Subramaniam. He brings live-coding to a new level, all of his talks are entertaining and interesting. The top 4 talks bore his name three times.</p>

<p>Another thing I really enjoyed was the series of talks by Mark Reinhold/Alan Bateman (and at JavaOne also Alex Buckley) on the Jigsaw project. If you want to spend just an hour learning about this topic, I highy suggest watching: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU1WFX8yeKM">Advanced Modular Development</a>. This talk covers everything you’ll need to know once Java 9 is released and you’re going to use it.</p>

<h1 id="random-remarks">Random remarks</h1>

<p>JavaOne: This was the first time I’ve been there since Oracle aquired Sun. I really enjoyed the conference although the Hilton &amp; Parc 55 location isn’t as convenient as Moscone.</p>

<p>JavaOne: I really liked having Duke’s Café to talk to all of my conference-buddies. Also: If you ever see someone alone at a conference, walk there and say hello. Being at such a huge conference can (surprisingly) be a very lonely experience. Most programmers aren’t very outgoing, me included, but I’ve started forcing myself to talk to people that look like other introverts that might be lonely. I’ve never had a bad experience talking to people, only fun times!</p>

<p>Devoxx: It is (for me) the best Java conference in the world, the quality of the talks was very high again. The atmosphere was awesome. And I’m not just saying this because I volunteer during the conference :-)</p>
