    <p class="author">
      <span class="date">Apr 19, 2011 18:13:55</span>
    </p>
    <p>Today somebody posted a comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>
'Could you write a post giving more details on why you think<br />
checked exceptions are "the embodiment of evil"?'</p></blockquote>
<p>So here it is.<br />
<!--more--><br />
As you can see I haven't written a post in a long time (sorry). This post is also not going to be very comprehensive. Of course I could explain everything, but I'd rather link to another site which sums it up very nicely:<br />
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheProblemWithCheckedExceptions">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheProblemWithCheckedExceptions</a></p>
<p>Basically, I don't want to be forced to handle exceptions. Also, having to catch checked exceptions makes code unreadable, complex and harder to change/refactor.</p>
<p>Of course I'm also aware that with runtime exceptions you are likely to forget to catch some exceptions, which is also very bad. That is why our application(s) catch and log all runtime exceptions and mail them to the developers. Execptions are always something very bad and should not be functional, exceptions should be... exceptions. Once they happen, all hell should break out and it should be fixed.</p>

    <p class="author">
      <span class="date">Feb 24, 2011 22:29:29</span>
    </p>
    <p>Follow up on the previous blogpost.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wrote an algorithm in Java to generate de Bruijn sequences. But I had a breakthrough after reading:</p>
<p><i>K. Cattell, F. Ruskey, J. Sawada, M. Serra, C.R. Miers, Fast algorithms to generate necklaces, unlabeled necklaces, and irreducible polynomials over GF(2)</i></p>
<p>It has an algorithm which generates Lyndon words in CAT. CAT stands for Constant Amortized Time. This means that is isn't really constant time, but approaches it very much. Calculating the worst-case scenario isn't worth it. For example using an ArrayList in Java. The time to do insertions is said to be O(1), and this is true.... until the array underneath needs to be resized. During this resize it'll take some more time. So the algorithm isn't really constant time, but constant amortized time.</p>
<p>This is the program I ended up with. It is very very small. One of my most beautiful pieces of code. And it even supports non-binary alphabets (use the k-parameter).</p>
<pre class="brush:java">
	public String generateDeBruijnSequence(int k, int n) {
		StringBuilder sequence = new StringBuilder();
		generateLyndonWords(1, 1, k, new int[n+1], sequence);
		return sequence.toString();
	}
	
	private void generateLyndonWords(int t, int p, int k, int[] a, StringBuilder sequence) {
		if (t &gt; a.length-1) {
			if((a.length-1)%p==0) {
				for(int i = 1; i &lt; p+1;i++) {
					sequence.append(a[i]);
				}
			}
		} else {
			a[t] = a[t-p]; 
			generateLyndonWords(t+1,p, k, a, sequence);
			for(int j=a[t-p]+1; j&lt;=k-1; j++) {
				a[t] = j; 
				generateLyndonWords(t+1,t, k, a, sequence);
			}
		}
	}
</pre>
<p><strong>Update June 7th 2012:</strong><br />
I just stumbled across this interesting read: <a href="http://www.learner.org/courses/mathilluminated/units/2/textbook/07.php">http://www.learner.org/courses/mathilluminated/units/2/textbook/07.php</a></p>
<p>The keypad example from that link can be easily calculated with the code above:<br />
generateDeBruijnSequence(9, 5).length() = 59049 :-)</p>

    <h1><a href="/blog/2011/02/generating-de-bruijn-sequences-and-lyndon-words/">Generating de Bruijn sequences and Lyndon words</a></h1>
    <p class="author">
      <span class="date">Feb 24, 2011 10:32:52</span>
    </p>
    <p>Not so long ago I encountered something called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_sequence">de Bruijn sequence</a>. For now I'll only use this for an alphabet of (0,1), binary. But everything said here could also be applied to other alphabets. In this post I'll describe what this sequence is, and how you can generate them, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_word">Lyndon words</a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>What is a de Bruijn sequence?</h2>
<p>Well, it is a sequence (again, in this case binary) which contains all combinations/permutations of a specific length. And it does this only once.<br />
For example: B(2,4)</p>
<ul>
<li>000100110101111 (000)</li>
</ul>
<p>This sequence contains all possible permutations you can make in binary of length 4. The last part (000) is optional, and needed it you do not want the sequence looped. As you can see, the length of this sequence is 16. All sequences will have length 2^N.</p>
<h2>How do you construct these sequences?</h2>
<p>The next thing I wanted to know is how to construct these sequences. The first hit I got was from the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/deBruijnSequence.html">MathWorld</a> website. It states:<br />
<small><i>Surprisingly, it turns out that the lexicographic sequence of Lyndon words of lengths divisible by N gives the lexicographically smallest de Bruijn sequence (Ruskey).</i></small></p>
<h2>Lyndon word..?</h2>
<p>It seems that the next step is generating Lyndon words. Lyndon words are the lexographically smallest rotation of a word. I haven't yet found a proper way to do this (I know there are) so here is what I do:</p>
<p>Pseudo:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">
lastLyndon = -1
for all possible N's {
    currentSmallestLyndon = smallestLyndonRotation(N)
    if( currentSmallestLyndon &gt; lastLyndon ) {
        lastLyndon = currentSmallestLyndon
        print currentSmallestLyndon
    }
}
</pre>
<p>And here is what I used to generate the smallestLyndonRotation (Java):</p>
<pre class="brush:java">
	private BigInteger smallestLyndonRotation(BigInteger input, int size) {
		BigInteger lowestForm = input;
		BigInteger mask = BigInteger.ONE;
		for(int i = 1;i&lt;size;i++) {
			BigInteger possibleLowerForm = (input.and(mask).shiftLeft(size-i)).or(input.and(mask.negate()).shiftRight(i));
			mask = mask.or(mask.shiftLeft(1));
			if(possibleLowerForm.compareTo(lowestForm) == -1) {
				lowestForm = possibleLowerForm;
			}
		}
		return lowestForm;
	}
</pre>
<p>How does it work? Well, for example the input is: 0010.<br />
It loops over all rotations (using some bit-masking):</p>
<ul>
<li>0010</li>
<li>0100</li>
<li>1000</li>
<li>0001</li>
</ul>
<p>And finds the smallest lexographically (0001) and returns this.</p>
<p>The above pseudo code will spit out the following numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>0000</li>
<li>0001</li>
<li>0011</li>
<li>0101</li>
<li>0111</li>
<li>1111</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all the Lyndon words for N=4.</p>
<h2>Splitting, reducing the Lyndon words</h2>
<p>Now if we put the Lyndon words together we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>000000010011010101111111 (our sequence)</li>
<li>0000100110101111 (de Bruijn sequence)</li>
</ul>
<p>We aren't quite there yet... but there is some resemblance. There is one more step left, we have to reduce/split the Lyndon words into its smallest unique part.</p>
<p>Lets take the Lyndon words again:</p>
<ul>
<li>0000 -> 0 (4x)</li>
<li>0001 -> 0001</li>
<li>0011 -> 0011</li>
<li>0101 -> 01 (2x)</li>
<li>0111 -> 0111</li>
<li>1111 -> 1 (4x)</li>
</ul>
<p>Results in: 0000100110101111, the sequence!</p>
<p>And that is it! If we've created the smallest possible de Bruijn sequence for B(2,4).</p>
<p>Here are some more sequences:</p>
<ol>
<li>01</li>
<li>0011</li>
<li>00010111</li>
<li>0000100110101111</li>

    <h1><a href="/blog/2011/02/unit-testing-a-chess-engine/">Testing a chess engine</a></h1>
    <p class="author">
      <span class="date">Feb 7, 2011 10:02:46</span>
    </p>
    <p>About a week ago I decided to try and write a chess engine. I've encountered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard">bitboards</a> before, and I really liked working with them. Most references I found had to do with chess engines, so I decided to have a go.</p>
<p><!--more--><br />
The single most important and time consuming aspect of building a chess engine is legal <a href="http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Move+Generation">move generation</a>. In all situations, be able to generate all legal moves that can be made on the board. At first this seems pretty straight forward, all pieces can move and attack in certain ways. But when you get to specific rules like castling and en-passant things get really tricky.</p>
<p>But how do you know for sure your engine works and gets the right results? The many chess engine developers around the world found a great solution for this problem. Something I can only describe as universal integration-tests! They call it "perft" (from performance test). The first thing they do it create a particulair situation on the chess board. This can be described like in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation">FEN notation</a>.<br />
For example:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain"> 
rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
(initial chess starting position)
</pre>
<p>All chess engines use this small language and understand how to set up their internal board. The next step is to generate all possible moves. From the example FEN above all possible moves are just 20 moves. But why stop here? From these 20 moves calculate all legal moves the opponent can make (also 20) which results in 400 moves. Continue doing this and you'll end up with a table like this:</p>

</table>
<p>As you can see, the numbers in these tables quickly become huge. This will ensure that a lot of situations are tested. Using these tables you can check if your program outputs the same values, and thus complies to all the rules. There are a lot of these tables online, using a FEN for starting position, and a table with all nodes that can be generated.</p>
<p>The next problem is, when your numbers don't add up, how do you find the move 6 levels deep that goes wrong? Well, some engines can help you with that. Personally I used <a href="http://www.rocechess.ch/rocee.html">ROCE</a> (Roman's Own Chess Engine). His engine has a "divide" function. First you set the board in a certain position using the FEN, and then you call the divide function, for example "divide 6". Now it shows a table like this:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain"> 
move : nodes
e2e4 1249
e2e3 2356
f2f3 5356
f2f4 6436
(etc)
</pre>
<p>This lists each node at level 1, and after that each number of nodes it results in at depth 6. If you also have this function in your own chess engine you can compare the numbers. Now you can pinpoint which of the first nodes contains the error. Do this move and try divide 5. This will guide you all the way to the specific move that is (or isn't) created! This was a huge help, and I love the way chess engine developers devised a way to have a kind of universal integration-tests which will point out the most commonly made bugs. You can take these tables, load them in a automatic test and keep running them every nights to see if things are still working like it should.</p>
<p>How did my engine end up? Well, it worked perfect in the sense that it could generate all the good legal moves. Then I added a simple evaluation function and it could play chess. After that I implemented a simple search algorithm (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning">alpha-beta</a> using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax">negamax</a>) and it could beat two simple other chess engines and myself. And of course, after a week, I lost interest again and writing a blogpost about it is usually the nail to the coffin of most of my projects.</p>
<p>So, what should I tackle next? I'm looking forward to having a new <a href="http://azspcs.net/">AZsPCs</a> competition, but I think this might take a while...</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> A couple of readers have pointed out that these tests are obviously not <i>unit tests</i>, but rather integration or acceptance tests. You are completely right. I've called them Unit tests because I used JUnit and they run in the automatic build. But they do test integration..!</p>

    <h1><a href="/blog/2011/01/exception-mailing/">Exception mailing</a></h1>
    <p class="author">
      <span class="date">Jan 6, 2011 00:36:51</span>
    </p>
    <p>
A couple of weeks ago our Scrum team was thinking about exception handling. We don't use checked exceptions, since they are the embodiment of evil. So everything is translated into runtime exceptions whenever possible. But this is where the problems start: What do you do with the uncatched runtime exceptions?</p>
<h1>Taking it one step further</h1>
<p>Most projects will decide to just write the exceptions to the console, maybe to a log file. In some cases there is specialized software which will analyze log files, detect stacktraces and act on them. We decided to create a fast specialized solution. We want to have a mailbox where all the runtime exceptions end up, including stacktrace, system properties, program properties and even a screenshot.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Catching the uncaught exception</h2>
<p>In Java you can set a exception handlers on Threads. You can set a handler on a Thread, but it is also possible to set a default exception handler. It is very easy:</p>
<pre class="brush:java">
public class CustomUncaughtExceptionHandler implements UncaughtExceptionHandler {

    public CustomUncaughtExceptionHandler() {
        Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void uncaughtException(final Thread t, final Throwable throwable) {
        //do something here!    
    }
}
</pre>
<p>If an exception occurs, the uncaughtException method will be called. Then you can do anything you want with the throwable. As said before, we decided it is best for us that the application phones home and sends us an email with as much information as we can get.</p>
<h1>What to send?</h1>
<p>Our application is launched by JNLP and will run on several clients. We don't have complete contol over these clients, so we want to include as much information as possible to solve possible bugs in the application. The more information we have about the runtime, the easier it might be to find the problem. We grab all (relevant) system properties and program properties we can get. Including usernames, machine details.</p>
<h2>Creating a screenshot</h2>
<p>In Java there are actually two methods of creating a screenshot. The first method is the easiest, using the Java Robot:</p>
<pre class="brush:java">
Robot robot = new Robot();
 
BufferedImage screenShot = robot.createScreenCapture(new Rectangle(Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize()));
</pre>
<p>Very easy, but this can contain a LOT of information about the moment the exception occurs. It may provide valuable information. But we encountered a major security problem with the above method. Java will create an actual screenshot, the size of your application. But it doesn't know if your application is currently the active window..! When we did tests we saw screenshots with Skype messages in screen and browsers being active... We can't invade the lives of our users and send this information over the mail!</p>
<p>So I decided to search for something less invasive. The main frame of our application has a paint method, and most of the time this method can still be called if we have an exception. It is possible to create our own Graphics object and let the main frame paint itself into memory. So eventually I settled on the code below:</p>
<pre class="brush:java">
    private BufferedImage createScreenshot() {
        try {
            // Try to repaint the main frame of our application:
            int w = this.screenshotComponent.getWidth();
            int h = this.screenshotComponent.getHeight();
            BufferedImage image = new BufferedImage(w, h, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);
            this.screenshotComponent.paintAll(image.getGraphics());
            // We can't use Robot, it might capture a bit too much information
            return image;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Screen can't be captured, don't throw exception, else we'll end up in a loop :-)
            return null;
        }
    }
</pre>
<h2>Mailing the exception</h2>
<p>The next step in our solution is sending an email with all the information. This is done using Java Mail, an API to send emails. More about sending emails from Java <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-06-1999/jw-06-javamail.html?page=4">here</a>. In our case we create a pretty HTML email with all relevant information and three attachements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text file with all system properties</li>
<li>Text file with the complete exception</li>
<li>The image/screenshot</li>
</ul>
<p>To create the email it is easy to create MimeBodyParts which contain the text, the only part a bit more complicated it to add the screenshot inside the email, this can be done using:</p>
<pre class="brush:java">
	public MimeBodyPart createImagePart(final BufferedImage screenshot)
			throws MessagingException {

		if (screenshot == null) {
			return null;
		}

		MimeBodyPart imagePart = new MimeBodyPart();
		ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
		try {
			ImageIO.write(screenshot, "jpg", outputStream);
		} catch (IOException ioException) {
			// Impossible to get the screenshot, return null and continue without it
			return null;
		}

		DataSource source = new ByteArrayDataSource(outputStream.toByteArray(), "image/jpeg");
		imagePart.setDataHandler(new DataHandler(source));
		imagePart.setFileName("screenshot.jpg");
		imagePart.setContentID("<screenshot>");
		return imagePart;
	}
</screenshot></pre>
<p>The only non-obvious line in the code above is setting the ContentID, this can be used to refer to the image-data in case of an HTML email. In the main email content I added the following line:</p>
<pre class="brush:html">
        Screenshot: <img src="/images/cid:screenshot" alt="Screenshot of the moment the exception occured." />
</pre>
<p>The <i>src="cid:screenshot"</i> will cause the email to show the screenshot embedded inside the email. This makes the exception-email look very pretty.</p>
<h1>Even more in the future...?</h1>
<p>With our current implementation we'll be able to detect exceptions instantly (on every new email). Also we'll have more information then just a stacktrace, we have a screenshot and some parameters/system properties which can help us re-create the situation.</p>
<p>To improve this even more I'm planning on adding a simple bounded FIFO queue. This queue will contain a list of actions performed by the user. These user-actions can be added automatically by using aspect oriented programming. For example annotating all the service methods. Everytime a service method is called we can add it to the bounded queue, which has a maximum of N elements, for example 20. If an exception occurs we print our the current queue, we can read the last N actions leading up to the exception. This too can be very helpful in re-creating the situation.</p>
<p>What more information could be useful in an debug email like this? How do you guys solve exception handling?</p>

    <h1><a href="/blog/2011/01/rainbow-tables/">Rainbow tables, reverse hash lookup</a></h1>
    <p class="author">
      <span class="date">Jan 1, 2011 17:17:25</span>
    </p>
    <p>Today I've been looking into rainbow tables. These are tables used to do a reverse lookup for a hash function. For example MD5, or Windows LAN Manager. Usually these tables are used to find passwords if the hash is known. Now I'm not looking for a method to crack somebodies computer, but the technology and algorithms involved are very advanced and might be usefull in other fields as well!<br />
<!--more--></p>
<h2>Hashing</h2>
<p>First off, lets talk about 'hashing', what is hashing? Well, a hash-function is a one-way function which turns some data (usually text) into a hashcode. For example... passwords:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">
"test"     -> "098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6"
"password" -> "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99"
</pre>
<p>Every good website which takes security seriously will only store these MD5 hashes in their databases, not the real passwords. So even if their database is compromised the attackers don't have anything, because the hash-function is only one-way.</p>
<h2>Attacking a hash</h2>
<p>Where there is security there will be crackers trying to break it. How would you go about attacking, reversing, a hash? The earliest form was just to create huge tables of:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">
PLAIN_TEXT -> HASH
</pre>
<p>And then check if the hash is your hash. If you have a match, you'll get into the system!</p>
<p>The problem is that these tables take a very long time to compute and you'll end up with so much data you won't be able to store it. This made hashing pretty safe.</p>
<h2>Rainbow tables</h2>
<p>A couple of generations further down the line, crackers now use rainbow tables. It takes the best of both worlds having a small(-ish) table on disk, and doing minimal computations. So how do they work..?</p>
<h3>The reduce function</h3>
<p>Lets assume we start with a random piece of text. For example we want to crack all passwords of length 5 and consisting of [ABC...XYZ0123456789]. We can now calculate the hash value. Instead of storing this single pair, we do a little trick. We use something that is called a 'reduce function'. This is a selfmade one-way function that turns a hash back into a password! But not the original password (it isn't a reverse hash-function) but just into some other password.</p>
<p>Why would we do that? Lets continue, we take our first random password, generate a hash, and then we reduce it back to another password. This is then again hashed, reduced, hashed, reduced for lets say 1000 times. We'll end up with:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">
Hash:   "random"                           -> "7ddf32e17a6ac5ce04a8ecbf782ca509"
Reduce: "7ddf32e17a6ac5ce04a8ecbf782ca509" -> "ienw3"
Hash:   "ienw3"                            -> "b9322e367ad002d5adf7ca60b8b61e86"
        ... (1000 times) ...
Hash:   "o1gti"                            -> "27aa4cbd3653a4617e0aec76ba3af9a4"
</pre>
<p>The trick is, we throw away everything except the first input "random" and the final hash "27aa4cbd3653a4617e0aec76ba3af9a4"! This is the only part we need to store.</p>
<h3>Using a rainbow table</h3>
<p>How can we use the data above to reverse hashes you might ask? To use this table we need the input hash. For example "b9322e367ad002d5adf7ca60b8b61e86". First we check if this hash is in the database. If it is, we are very lucky, we can just re-generate that particulair chain and we know the plain text input!</p>
<p>If we don't find anything (which is very likely) we apply our reduce function to the input-hash and then hash that result. Now we check the hashes again, regenerate the chain and find out the answer. This can be repeated until we hit our set limit (1000) in that case, if no match has been found, we can't reverse it.</p>
<h3>False alarms</h3>
<p>There is one problem in this algorithm. If you take a input-hash and then do a couple of reduce/hashes, and then you find a match... it might be a false alarm! The problem is that there might be input strings that result in the same hash. If this happens two chains will end up into one chain.</p>
<p>If we would have done a couple of reduce/hashes from our input and find a match for endpoint "52cafa6b5e4a6509e6ed2b8e6976d780", the original chain might not have contained our input value. When we construct the complete chain it is possible that our input-hash isn't in the chain...!</p>
<h3>The 'rainbow' of the rainbow table</h3>
<p>The reason they call it a rainbow table has something to do with reducing the amount of false alarms. Until now we've talked about having one reduce-function. What if we would have multiple reduce functions? Then we could create multiple small tables, which would help reduce a little bit.</p>
<p>Philippe Oechslin had a great idea. He used a different reduce algorithm for each step in the chain. So his tables are build using:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">
input chain 1 -> hash -> reduce1 -> hash -> reduce2 -> .... -> reduceN -> hash
input chain 2 -> hash -> reduce1 -> hash -> reduce2 -> .... -> reduceN -> hash
input chain 3 -> hash -> reduce1 -> hash -> reduce2 -> .... -> reduceN -> hash
</pre>
<p>(If you color the reduce functions you'll end up with a pretty rainbow pattern).</p>
<p>How would you reverse a hash using this method? Well, the first step is the same, check if your input-hash is present in the stored hashes.<br />
Next we apply: </p>
<pre class="brush:plain">
reduce1000 -> hash -> check
reduce999 -> hash -> reduce1000 -> hash -> check
reduce998 -> hash -> reduce999 -> hash -> reduce1000 -> hash -> check
</pre>
<p>(etc)</p>
<p>The big advantage is that similair hashes (collisions) will most likely use different reduce algorithms so they won't end up in the same chain.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Using rainbow tables you greatly decrease the amount of stored values. It isn't log(O), there is a bit of computation needed to do the lookups, but that as well is kept to a minimum. This results in a very fast method to crack passwords. But I think it can be used in other fields of computer science as well. There are a lot of situations where you'd like to have a very big hash-lookup table, and when it becomes too big, this can be used to reduce storage but maintain fairly good lookup times.</p>
<h2>Salting</h2>
<p>Almost every article about hashing and rainbow tables end with a short alinea about salting. You can do salting in a couple of different ways, but the idea is usually the same. The easiest form of salting is having on 'salt' for a complete database.</p>
<h3>One salt per database</h3>
<p>How does this work? Well, lets just generate a completely random piece of text: "thisisoursaltanditisverylarge". Now every time we store a new user we do "MD5(password + salt)". Because the password itself may be weak, we apply our large "database-salt" to it, and then we calculate the hash. </p>
<p>Now if you want to crack a hash in this system it is almost impossible. Unless you find out the salt, then you could re-create a complete rainbow table and crack all the passwords.</p>
<h3>Using a user value as salt</h3>
<p>An even better solution is to use a user-value as salt, for example their username or date of birth, or maybe their registration date/time. Now if somebody cracks the database and finds all the data they'll have to create a new rainbow table for each seperate user (!!!). This is even more secure and preferred over the database-salt.</p>
<h3>Just generate a random sequence...</h3>
<p>But the single best way of salting your database is to generate a large random salt for each user. You can just store this salt in the database next to the hash of the password. This is better then, for example, the username, because there are just less collisions. For example usernames like "root" or "admin" aren't very uncommon aren't they? So creating a rainbow table with "root" as salt might be worth the trouble. But creating one with a large random number just for a single user? That is hard and they'll probably quickly give up.</p>
<h2>Other uses for this algorithm</h2>
<p>I haven't been able to come up with a good other use for this algorithm yet, but I have the feeling tons of problems could potentially benefit from it! Can you come up with one?</p>

    <p>Many projects I've worked on, especially the projects using micro-optimization, had memory leaks and surprising performance hits. Most coders who work on for example Al Zimmermann's programming contests use C/C++ and maybe even CUDA to get the most out of their system.</p>
<p>I'm usually using Java, just because I'm most at home in this language. It allows me to quickly get some working code and test some algorithms. But when I reach the final phase of the project it is time to micro-optimize everything.</p>
<p>The first tool I've tried it <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/visualvm/index.html">Java Visual VM</a>. This tool is available in all the new <del datetime="2010-12-14T12:07:57+00:00">Sun</del> Oracle JVM's. Just go to the bin-directory and type <i>jvisualvm</i>. This program will attach to your running code and tries to extract all the information. The good part of this tool is the price, it is free!</p>
<p>But if you really need to know what it going on inside your project, you should try YourKit. YourKit is kindly supporting open source projects with its full-featured Java Profiler.

    <h1><a href="/blog/2010/11/xor-doubly-linked-list/">XOR doubly linked list</a></h1>
    <p class="author">
      <span class="date">Nov 24, 2010 10:50:02</span>
    </p>
    <p>Since a couple of days I've been working hard on the new Al Zimmermann's Programming Contest: <a href="http://azspcs.net/Contest/Cards">Cards</a> (also called Topswops).</p>
<h1>The challenge</h1>
<p>The idea is very easy, you take a series of numbers, from 1 to N. You shuffle the numbers around, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>5,3,1,2,4</li>
</ul>
<p><!--more--><br />
Now we reverse the amount of numbers as stated by the first entry in the list. So in this case we reverse 5, and we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>4,2,1,3,5 </li>
</ul>
<p>We keep doing this, now reversing 4:</p>
<ul>
<li>3,1,2,4,5</li>
<li>2,1,3,4,5</li>
<li>1,2,3,4,5</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, 1 is in front, we are done! No more reversals are possible.</p>
<h1>The problems</h1>
<p>When implementing this the first thing I did was to create an array and reverse parts of the array by swapping the items around. The problem is that the amount of swaps is pretty big! </p>
<p>So I started thinking about other ways to save the numbers in this challenge.. how about a linked list? This won't work because when updating the linked list you'll have to reverse all the pointers in the part you are reversing.</p>
<p>So how about using a doubly linked list? This won't work because we have to swap the next/previous pointers for all the nodes we reverse.</p>
<h1>XOR doubly linked list</h1>
<p>Then I learned about the XOR doubly linked list. Let me explain how it works. The idea is that you don't have next and previous pointers, but you just have one pointer. This pointer is both the next AND the previous pointer! How is this possible you might ask?</p>
<p>Well, this is where the XOR comes into play. Lets do a tiny bit of math:<br />
A ^ B = C<br />
Now:<br />
C ^ A = B<br />
C ^ B = A</p>
<p>A property of the XOR is, if we have one value, we can calculate what the other value is!</p>
<p>When we create the list we XOR the next and previous together, and we save the pointer to the first element in a seperate pointer. Lets say A = previous, B = next, C = stored value:</p>
<ul>
<li>previous ^ next = stored value</li>
<li>stored value ^ previous = next</li>
<li>stored value ^ next = previous</li>
</ul>
<p>If we traverse our XOR doubly linked list we know the current element and the one before that (previous), so we can always calculate the pointer to the next element!</p>
<h1>The advantages</h1>
<p>So why would we do this? It involves a bit more processing power and will obviously save you half of the pointer-memory compared to a normal doubly linked list. We now keep one XOR-ed value instead of two pointers.</p>
<p>But there is another great advantage which might be usefull in the competition I mentioned above, reversability! As stated above using a doubly linked list wasn't helpfull because when we reverse a part all the previous and next pointers have to be swapped. But we don't have these pointers anymore, they are XOR-ed into one value! That means that we don't have to change anything!</p>
<p>Lets assume we have a list of 80 items, and we want to reverse the first 40, what do we need to do now?</p>
<ol>
<li>Traverse to the 40th element</li>
<li>Adjust the value of the 40th pointer, now the first element:<br />
TERMINATOR ^ (PTR TO 39)</li>
<li>Adjust the value of the 1st pointer, it must have<br />
(PTR TO 2) ^ (PTR TO 41)</li>
<li>Adjust the value of the 41th pointer, it must have<br />
(PTR TO 1) ^ (PTR TO 42)</li>
<li>Pointer to the first element is now 40 (this has become our first element)</li>
</ol>
<p>Done! We have adjusted three pointers and nothing in the middle. B.t.w. TERMINATOR is a value which indicates the boundaries of the first and last elements, I've used -1 for this. When traversing we use this to check if we are done.</p>
<p>Lets traverse the above reversed list, first we go to the first element (40) and perform the following XOR:</p>
<ul>
<li>stored_value (40) ^ TERMINATOR = next (39)</li>
</ul>
<p>This will result in 39, now we continue:</p>
<ul>
<li>stored_value (39) ^ previous (40) = next (38)</li>
<li>stored_value (38) ^ previous (39) = next (37)</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>stored_value (2) ^ previous (3) = next (1)</li>
<li>stored_value (1) ^ previous (2) = next (41) !!</li>
<li>stored_value (41) ^ previous (1) = next (42) !!</li>
<li>stored_value (42) ^ previous (41) = next (43) etc etc</li>
</ul>
<p>It works!</p>
<h1>A bit of dissapointment</h1>
<p>After implementing this it doesn't seem to be faster then using swaps to reverse everything in the whole array. This is probably due to a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The locality of a normal array is faster in memory</li>
<li>You'll have to traverse N-nodes to reach the target to reverse</li>
<li>The competition has max 97 elements, this might be too small to see the advantage</li>
</ul>
<p>My algorithm until now only used a single pointer to keep track of the first element, but it might be usefull to also keep a pointer to the last element. For example if we need to reverse everything up to N-1, I need to traverse from 1 to N-1. But if you have a last-element pointer, using the doubly in the XOR doubly linked list, we can just go backwards from N.</p>
<p>Ah well, it might not have been usefull (yet?) but it is a beautiful algorithm!</p>

    </p>
    <p>After a lot of comments on my blog asking about the code I decided to try getting it released one more time. Thus I mailed Digital Landmark Services again, telling them this is just a hobby project, and will (in its current form) never be a replacement for Shazam. Also, I explained a lot of people hated Shazam and deleted the application after reading this blog... the only thing they got out of it is bad marketing.</p>
<p>So I asked them for a peaceful solution, I'll release the code, tell everybody Landmark Digital Services is a good company after all, and that's it, both will benefit.</p>
<p>This is the reply I got:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Mr. Van Rijn,</p>
<p>I am an attorney for Landmark Digital Services.  Thank you for your response and attention to this important matter.  As we have stated in detail in previous communications, we would like you to refrain from releasing the code and to remove the blogpost explaining the algorithm.  While we appreciate your thoughtful comments and questions, we have already made our position clear and hope you will respect our interest in our IP.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />

<p>WHAT!? They tell me again to remove the blogpost, this is crazy! A blogpost describing an algorithm can never be infrigement of intellectual property. The whole idea of a patent is to preserve an idea, to write down what it does and how it works for future generations. A patent has to be publicly available for this sole reason. This isn't protecting their intellectual property, this is plain censorship.</p>
<p>My reply to the email was short an concise:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm sorry, but I can't comply. </p>
<p>Good luck.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was a week ago, lets see what they come up with this time...</p>

    <p class="author">
      <span class="date">Sep 23, 2010 12:37:02</span>
    </p>
    <p>A couple of days ago I noticed this tweet:<br />
<strong><br />
<a title="berengual" href="http://twitter.com/berenguel/status/25061642637"><strong>berenguel</strong></a>: What is your view on 'frame switching'?How do you manage (forced) interruptions of your workflow?How do you get the interruptor to give up?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This is something I'm currently not experiencing, but I have been fighting this in the past. And I've come up with a quite effective way to eliminate this.<br />
<!--more--><br />
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-557" title="Post-it" src="/images/post-it-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></p>
<h1>Priority todo-list</h1>
<p>I'm just a regular guy, and just like all men I can only focus on a single thing. Context swithing/frame of reference switching is hard. If I'm working on a programming problem and people interrupt me, ask other technical questions, I lose my train of thought.</p>
<p>So, how do you counter this? Well, first I made a list of things to do. This is always good to have, it directs your focus. My list is priorized. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement "General overview" page</li>
<li>Fix bug with disappearing "Solve" button</li>
<li>Refactor OfflineAvailableController</li>
<li>Fix table layout bug</li>
</ul>
<p>Yay!</p>
<h1>Coffee time!</h1>
<p>The top post-it is the one I'm working on, that one has my complete focus. When the project lead comes and asks me questions, I ask him to prioritize it. He can add post-its to the list and/or shuffle the list. But there is one catch: Every time he changes or I finish the top priority I need a coffee break. This is my frame-switching moment, to clear my head.</p>
<p>If you do this, and keep doing this (no exceptions!) the project lead will start putting his 'requests' (interruptions) beneath your current piece of work, without distracting you. Because else you go for a cup of coffee first.... This is what we want. When we finish what we are currently doing we get a little coffee break. When we've fully cleared our head we look at the next item in the todo-queue.</p>
<p>Don't worry, it may sound a bit rude, they'll understand it if you explain the problem with frame-switching...! This just makes it visible.</p>
<p>p.s. Berengual will probably write a blog post about his own experiences with frame-switching, I'll post a link when he does!</p>
