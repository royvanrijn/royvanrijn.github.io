    <h3>Adding resources</h3>
<p>Today I've (again) seen this quote on Twitter:</p>
<p><i><b>"A project manager is someone who thinks that 9 pregnant women can create a baby in 1 month"</b></i></p>
<p>This obviously isn't the case. The story demonstrates that adding more people to a team won't (necessarily) make the team more effective. Because some processes can't be cut into smaller pieces and taken up by more people. It will even cause a bit of overhead, more opinions and thus, more time.</p>

<h3>What about one woman?</h3>
<p>Everybody knows 9 women can't create a baby in 1 month... so it isn't fair to make that comparison. How about one pregnant woman and the project manager? </p>
<p>Four weeks into the 'project' the project manager has his monthly meeting with his pregnant wife:</p>
<p><b>Month #1</b><br />
Project manager: <i>"How is everything going?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"Oh, just fine, no problems at all"</i><br />
Project manager: <i>"Is there anything I can help you with?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"No, currently not, everything is going like it is supposed to"</i><br />
Project manager: <i>"When do you think this baby-project is going to be completed?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"Well, it takes 9 months, so 8 months from now!"</i></p>
<p><b>Month #2</b><br />
Project manager: <i>"Hey, is everything still going fine?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"Yes, still feeling fine."</i><br />
Project manager: <i>"Is there anything I can help you with?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"No, nothing that I can think of right now."</i></p>
<p><b>Month #3</b><br />
Project manager: <i>"Hey, still working on that baby?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"Yes, I'm starting to have a bit of morning sickness now..."</i><br />
Project manager: <i>"Oh, can I help you with that?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"Not really, it is just something I have to live with"</i><br />
Project manager: <i>"How does this affect the release date?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"It doesn't, I think... but I really wish we could release a bit sooner!"</i></p>
<p><b>Month #4</b><br />
Project manager: <i>"Hey, still having that morning sickness issue?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"A little bit, but it is almost gone now"</i><br />
Project manager: <i>"Still on track for the release date?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"Yes, 5 months from now!"</i></p>
<p><b>Month #5</b><br />
Project manager: <i>"How is it going? Morning sickness issue resolved?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"Yes, but I need icecream and pickles."</i><br />
Project manager: <i>"I'm on it. Any updates about the release date?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"ICECREAM!"</i></p>
<p><b>Month #6</b><br />
Project manager: <i>"Anything I can do for you right now?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"Yes, I think you can start building that baby room"</i><br />
Project manager: <i>"When do you need it, when is the baby ready?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"Three months from now."</i></p>
<p><b>Month #7</b><br />
Project manager: <i>"The baby room is almost ready, how is that baby going?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"Just fine, just very tired. Two more months."</i></p>
<p><b>Month #8</b><br />
Project manager: <i>"I've got some more pickles for you!"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"You know I hate pickles :-( I'm tired..."</i><br />
Project manager: <i>"Sorry, how is the release coming along?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"One more month."</i></p>
<p><b>Month #9</b><br />
Project manager: <i>"Is the baby there yet?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"No, not yet, I'm tired but fine"</i><br />
Project manager: <i>"But...? What about the release?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"Go away."</i></p>
<p><b>Month #9 (plus one week)</b><br />
Project manager: <i>"What is the delay? Where is my baby?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"It isn't here yet."</i><br />
Project manager: <i>"How come? How did this happen!? I kept asking about the release date and you kept saying it would be done a week ago!?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"Get out."</i></p>
<p><b>Month #9 (plus two weeks)</b><br />
Wife: <i>"I'm ready! I've got this lovely baby for you."</i><br />
Project manager: <i>"Great, where did it go wrong with that planning?"</i><br />
Project manager: <i>"That babyroom has been ready for weeks now, and no baby!"</i><br />
Project manager: <i>"How can we keep this from happening next time? Scrum? Lean? Agile? RUP?"</i><br />
Wife: <i>"Screw you."</i></p>
<p>This story also has an important message in it, I'll just leave that as an exercise for the reader.</p>
